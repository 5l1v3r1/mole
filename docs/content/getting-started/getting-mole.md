# Getting Mole

Mole IDS is avaliable to the three major operating systems, which are Windows,
Linux and MacOS X. We offer Mole IDS in a 64bit static[^1] binary and also with
[PF_Ring](https://www.ntop.org/products/packet-capture/pf_ring/) for Linux.

The binaries are avaliable in the [Github release page](https://github.com/mole-ids/mole/releases).

[^1]: We compile and link as much as we can statically, but we can not compile
either WinPcap or Npcap statically for Windows.
