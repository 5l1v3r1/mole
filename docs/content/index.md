#Â MOLE NIDS

Mole IDS is a lightweight Network Intrusion Detection System powered with [Yara](https://virustotal.github.io/yara/).

Mole IDS is a command line tool that is able to capture the network traffic and
analyze it based on Yara rules. The Yara rules used in Mole IDS are barely crafted
for Mole IDS.
